// A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

// A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

// Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"

// Output: ["sweet","sour"]

// Explanation:

// The word "sweet" appears only in s1, while the word "sour" appears only in s2.

// Example 2:

// Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"

// Output: ["banana"]

 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200
// s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
// s1 and s2 do not have leading or trailing spaces.
// All the words in s1 and s2 are separated by a single space.

 * @param {string} s2
